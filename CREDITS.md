## Personalized Widgets

The files in [`src/gui/custom/adapted`](https://github.com/jp-zuniga/GaussBot/tree/main/src/gui/custom/adapted)
contain implementations of custom widgets used in GaussBot.

All of them are based on the work of [Akash Bora](https://github.com/akascape).

| Personalized Implementation | Original Widget Name |                                   Source                                    |  Licensed Under   |

|        `CustomTable`        |      `CTkTable`      |         [`Akascape/CTkTable`](https://github.com/Akascape/CTkTable)         |    MIT License    |
|          `Tooltip`          |     `CTkToolTip`     |       [`Akascape/CTkToolTip`](https://github.com/Akascape/CTkToolTip)       | CC0 1.0 Universal |

Generally speaking, the original code was heavily formatted and refactored.
A lot of the functionality aimed at general-purpose use was removed in the interest of simplicity.
Additionally, the widget designs were (in my humble opinion) greatly improved,
in order to better match the simple and modern look of GaussBot.

## Icons

All of the icons used in the UI were sourced from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com),
which offers free, attribution-based licenses for non-commercial uses.
For compatibility with GaussBot's themes, the original black icons were inverted to white using
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) for use in both light and dark modes.

Additionally, two of the icons were slightly modified:

* [M. Oki Orlando](https://thenounproject.com/creator/orvipixel/)'s
*"[Linear Algebra](https://thenounproject.com/icon/linear-algebra-4998468/)"* icon
was converted to a `.ico` image for use as the application's icon on Windows.
* [Sophia](https://thenounproject.com/creator/sophiabai/)'s
*"[Dropdown Arrow](https://thenounproject.com/icon/dropdown-arrow-1590826/)"* icon
was rotated to obtain up, left, and right-pointing versions.
